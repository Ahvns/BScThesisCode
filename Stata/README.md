# Stata code for Bachelor Thesis

This folder contains all files used in Stata during the writing of my bachelor thesis.

## Stata files

This repo will contain all Stata-related files used while writing my thesis.
I'll upload do files, dta files generated by my code, and links to user-written packages used.

## Data
All source data files will be uploaded here, as used in my thesis.
Most of these are edited by hand, of which some even completely transcripted from their original source by me.
I'll provide a document containing links to the original sources later.
